[//]: # ( Equipment Durability )

# Equipment Durability
There's lots of interesting equipment to be found, but most of it gets ignored once the 'optimal' equipment is found.  This mod aims to rectify that by giving equipment a limited durability, incentivizing swapping out your equipment from time to time.  Using your equipment repeatedly in quick succession wears it out even faster, so beware those who are tempted by the Gesture of the Drowned.

### Overheating and Breakage
All equipments have a limited durability.  When you use an equipment, it loses a small amount of durability, with extra durability loss if activated by Gesture of the Drowned.  When the durability is exhausted, the equipment breaks and you'll need to find something new.

### Installation
Place JarlykMods.Durability.dll in your BepInEx\plugins folder.  If you're using a Mod Manager, it may place it under its own folder under plugins, which is also fine.
