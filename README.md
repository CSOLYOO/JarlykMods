# Jarlyk Mods
This is a collection of various mods for the game Risk of Rain 2.  

### Development
This Git repo includes mod dependencies, but does not include the Unity or RoR2 Assemblies.  Prior to building, you'll need to copy the necessary files from the Managed folder in your RoR2 installation to the local Dependencies folder.

### Contact
You can reach me via Github or can find me on the modding Discord at https://discord.gg/5MbXZvd.  As with most mods, this is a hobby project, so please understand that response times to questions and time to update for new RoR2 releases may vary.
