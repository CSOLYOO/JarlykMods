            Class that defines a custom buff type for use in the game;
            you may omit the index in the BuffDef, as that will
            be assigned by ItemLib.

        <member name="T:ItemLib.CustomElite">
            <summary>
            Class that defines a custom Elite type for use in the game.
            All Elites consistent of an Elite definition, a <see cref="T:ItemLib.CustomEquipment"/>
            and a <see cref="T:ItemLib.CustomBuff"/>.  The equipment is automatically provided to
            the Elite when it spawns and is configured to passively apply the buff.
            Note that if Elite Spawning Overhaul is enabled, you'll also want to create a <see cref="!:EliteAffixCard"/>
            to allow the combat director to spawn your elite type.

            <summary>
            Custom equipment that the Elite will carry; do note that this is something that may (rarely) drop from the Elite when killed,
            so players can also end up with this equipment

            <summary>
            Custom buff that is applied passively by the equipment; note that this can be active on the player
            if they're using Wake of Vultures or pick up the equipment, so you'll need to decide what impact
            the elite buff should have on players.

        <member name="F:ItemLib.CustomElite.Tier">
            <summary>
            Tier for the elite, where 1 is standard elites (Fire, Ice, Lightning) and 2 is currently just Poison (Malachite).
            If Elite Spawning Overhaul is disabled, it will use this tier to set cost/hp/dmg scaling.  Even if your mod is
            only intended to work with ESO enabled, this should still be set to a valid number 1-2 for compatibility with
            the underlying game code.
