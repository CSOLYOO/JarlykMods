            Class that defines a custom buff type for use in the game;
            you may omit the index in the BuffDef, as that will
            be assigned by ItemLib.

            <summary>
            Class that defines a custom Elite type for use in the game.
            All Elites consistent of an Elite definition, a <see cref="T:ItemLib.CustomEquipment"/>
            and a <see cref="T:ItemLib.CustomBuff"/>.  The equipment is automatically provided to
            the Elite when it spawns and is configured to passively apply the buff.
            Note that if Elite Spawning Overhaul is enabled, you'll also want to create a <see cref="T:ItemLib.EliteAffixCard"/>
            to allow the combat director to spawn your elite type.

        <member name="F:ItemLib.CustomElite.Equipment">
            <summary>
            Custom equipment that the Elite will carry; do note that this is something that may (rarely) drop from the Elite when killed,
            so players can also end up with this equipment

            Custom buff that is applied passively by the equipment; note that this can be active on the player
            if they're using Wake of Vultures or pick up the equipment, so you'll need to decide what impact
            the elite buff should have on players.

        <member name="F:ItemLib.CustomElite.Tier">
            <summary>
            Tier for the elite, where 1 is standard elites (Fire, Ice, Lightning) and 2 is currently just Poison (Malachite).
            If Elite Spawning Overhaul is disabled, it will use this tier to set cost/hp/dmg scaling.  Even if your mod is
            only intended to work with ESO enabled, this should still be set to a valid number 1-2 for compatibility with
            the underlying game code.

        <member name="T:ItemLib.EliteAffixCard">
            <summary>
            Card specifying the spawn probability, cost and power level of a particular elite type.  Costlier elites
            will tend to only show up later in the game, but may still spawn quite often once the difficulty gets high
            enough that the CombatDirector has a lot of budget to work with.  You can use <see cref="F:ItemLib.EliteAffixCard.spawnWeight"/> to
            adjust how frequently the elite type spawns when it can afford it and can individually tweak each elite
            type's cost/dmg/hp boosts.  For extra fun, consider hooking the onSpawned delegate to add extra power, such
            as by granting items.  You can also create multiple cards for the same elite type, with different costs/weights.

            Provides a toolset for customizing elite spawning on a per-elite basis; this may be disabled in the ItemLib configuration,
            so consumers of this class may look at the <see cref="P:ItemLib.EliteSpawningOverhaul.Enabled"/> property to check this.  Cards are automatically created
            for the vanilla elite types with parameters matching those from the vanilla game.

            The cards used for assigning Elite affixes to spawned enemies; note that you may register multiple cards with the same EliteIndex,
            which can be useful for creating different 'tiers' of the same elite type, with stat boosts or other customization using the onSpawned delegate.
